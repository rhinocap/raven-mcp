# 2026-08-05 — pattern library, round 6 (key-isolation boundary + Sol round-5 dispositions)

Per-instance log. Continues `2026-08-05-pattern-library-round5.md`.

## Where this left off

All round-5 adverse findings are dispositioned and every surface is re-verified.
Nothing is pushed. `main` is 4 commits ahead of `origin/main` (`985e5ce`) and the
working tree below is uncommitted.

## 1. Andrew's reported bug — root-caused, reproduced, and now falsifiable

> "when I try to type an instruction in Github's search box starts opening and
> typing in there"

**Correction to the round-5 record:** a fix for this already existed and was
already committed in `7a30303` (`browser/raven-grab.js` ~1190) before the context
break. What this window added is a second, narrower guard for a residual the
first one's own comment named as uncovered — not the fix for the reported bug.

**Reproduction (live github.com through the bridge, both guards removed):**

```
AFTER {"dialogs":1,"active":"INPUT","activeIsRaven":false,
       "fieldValue":"I really like thi","searchDialogOpen":false}
```

The trailing `s` is swallowed and GitHub's dialog opens — the report and the
screenshot exactly. With both guards present: `fieldValue: "I really like this"`,
`dialogs: 0`, focus retained.

Eyes-on evidence, both logged-out github.com through the bridge:
`.claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/out/github-bug-reproduced-both-guards-removed.png`
shows "I really like thi" sitting in the instructions box with GitHub's search
panel open over the page — the defect, on the real site.
`…/github-overlay-on-github-before-typing.png` is the same surface before any
keystroke, for comparison.

**Why two guards, and why neither subsumes the other.**

- **Guard A — host, bubble phase** (`browser/raven-grab.js` ~1190, pre-existing).
  Broad: stops every key event. This is what fixed the reported bug.
- **Guard B — `window`, capture phase** (`browser/raven-grab.js` ~322, new).
  Narrow: unmodified single printable characters originating in a Raven field.
  `stopImmediatePropagation`, never `preventDefault` — the character still has to
  be typed.

Capture descends window → document → … → host, so a guard on the host can never
stop a document-capture listener. Measured with a four-phase spy on a proxied
page: with only Guard A installed, `docBubble`/`winBubble` were empty and
`docCapture`/`winCapture` still received every character, retargeted to the host
`<div>`. Registering on `window` in capture is the only position upstream of a
listener on `document`, and it wins by *position* rather than registration order,
which the overlay cannot control.

**Known residual, by choice:** window-capture stays open. Same-node ordering IS
registration order, and the bridge injects the overlay before `</body>`, so every
page script has already registered. Closing it means moving injection into
`<head>`, which reorders the whole overlay against the page it decorates. Not
worth it for a case no reported bug has hit — bare-letter hotkeys live on
`document` in practice (@github/hotkey, Mousetrap, hotkeys-js all bind there).

**Both guards are independently falsifiable** by the rewritten
`test/grab-overlay-key-isolation.test.mjs`: delete Guard B → test 1 red; delete
Guard A → test 3 red; both present → 3/3 green. The previous version of that file
listened in bubble phase only and passed with Guard B deleted, and used skip
sentinels that turned a broken build into a green run. Both anti-patterns removed.

## 2. Sol round-5 findings — verdict DOES NOT SURVIVE, all three dispositioned

**#1 (P1) drain protocol contradiction — CONFIRMED, FIXED.** `start_grab_session`
tells a proxied agent no `batchCommit` is coming; the drain contradicted it one
call later with "wait for the batchCommit marker from Apply", and proxy mode
withholds the route that would ever produce one. An agent that believes the drain
waits forever and the capture is never kept — the feature failing at its last
step. Added `isProxyGrabSession()` to `src/grab-bridge.ts`, a proxy branch in
`get_grabbed_elements` (`src/index.ts` ~3159), and an e2e assertion at the spot
Sol named.

**#2 (P1) WebSocket origin/cookie bypass — CONFIRMED, FIXED.** Upgrades attached
the session cookie jar unconditionally on the grounds the socket was same-site
"by construction". A WebSocket open is not subject to CORS, so any page can dial
`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` and have the bridge forward `SameSite=Strict` cookies
upstream on its behalf. The random port is a speed bump, not a boundary. Added an
`Origin` check in `proxyGrabUpgrade` (`src/grab-bridge.ts` ~1122) before the jar
is attached. Causality proven by neutering the check in `dist/` as
`if (false && …)` — the round-6 test goes red on exactly one assertion.

**#3 (P2) release path leaves apex `.mcpb` stale — PARTIALLY STALE, out of
scope.** `release.sh:109` already stages both copies and prints the manual-deploy
notice, so Sol's premise was half wrong. The real residual is that
`.github/workflows/release.yml` prints nothing, so an unattended workflow release
silently leaves `https://ravenmcp.ai/raven.mcpb` on the previous bundle. Not
fixed — release/deploy is Andrew's gate. `CLAUDE.md`'s landmine was corrected to
say what is actually true.

## 3. Verification (all re-run this window)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `RAVEN_NO_USAGE_LOG=1 npm test` | **1231 / 1228 pass / 0 fail / 3 skipped** (43.6s) | `.claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/out/FULL-SUITE-ROUND6b.log` |
| `node test/e2e-pattern-library.mjs` | **ALL CHECKS PASSED (33)** | `.../out/E2E-ROUND6.log` |
| `SKIP_BUILD=1 bash scripts/build-mcpb.sh` | both copies `10c7309f7b9a3c593cd4405b69a4eeffa3f99bfad87d4a3d503fedcddd251518` | — |
| stdio tool count | **108** (unchanged — an exported function is not a tool) | — |
| live anon endpoint | **45 tools**, `f64bb18…2bb0a6` — matches frozen golden | — |
| `browser/` vs `web/public/` overlay | byte-identical | — |

An earlier full run this window, before the Sol fixes, was 1228/1225/0/3.

## 3b. Round 7 — dispositioning the round-6 adverse pass

Sol round 6 returned **DOES NOT SURVIVE** on four of five claims. Six findings;
four accepted and fixed, two declined.

**F1 (was P1) — plain-HTTP cookie fail-open. FIXED.** The same bug class as the
WebSocket one, on the HTTP path and reachable by a wider set of clients:
`crossSite` was false whenever `sec-fetch-site` was absent, so a foreign page in
Safari <16.4 or a WebView could POST to the guessed loopback port and be handed
the proxied site's Strict jar with a same-origin `Origin` stamped on top. Order
is now Fetch Metadata → `Origin` host → `Referer` host → cross-site.

**F2 (P2) — drain classified by a global read after an await. FIXED.**
`getGrabbedElements` pins the session and returns `proxyMode` on the result.
`src/index.ts` reads that instead of calling `isProxyGrabSession()`.

**F3 (P2) — the server-level GRAB instruction still said "wait for batchCommit"
with no proxy exception. FIXED.** A server-level instruction outranks per-call
prose in practice, so the round-6 fix could lose the argument to it. The
exception now sits at the same level as the rule — **stdio only**, because the
remote surfaces register no grab tools and their instructions are hash-frozen
(putting it in the shared string broke `ANONYMOUS_INSTRUCTIONS_HASH`, which is
how the scoping error was caught).

**F4 (P2) — the capture guard missed IME and dead keys. FIXED.** `key.length
=== 1` excludes `Dead`/`Process`/`Unidentified`, and Android reports keyCode 229
for nearly everything, so every non-Latin and accented keystroke fell through to
the page's document-capture handler. Now also matches `isComposing`, keyCode 229
and those three key names.

**D1/D2 — declined.** The 45-tool hash test running against a local
`buildServer({remote:true})` rather than the deployed endpoint, and the e2e using
`InMemoryTransport`, are both pre-existing characterizations already ledgered in
`CLAUDE.md`, not regressions from this change set. The live endpoint was checked
by hand this session. Re-attacked in the round-7 brief as declines.

**Every fix was proven falsifiable before being believed** — reverted in `dist/`
and the intended test watched go red: F1 → the metadata-less cookie test; F2 →
the parked-drain test; F3 → the instruction test; F4 → the IME test (via
`RAVEN_GRAB_ASSET_PATH` pointed at a neutered overlay copy).

**Two corrections worth carrying forward.** My first race test passed with the
fix reverted — `getGrabbedElements` returns without yielding on the immediate
path, so the interleaving I wrote could never happen. Rewritten to park the drain
on a timeout, which is the only shape of the bug the public API exposes. And my
first F3 neutering silently failed to match (`grep -c` returned 0) while the
tests went green — a "reverted" run that never reverted anything proves nothing.
Check the substitution landed before reading the result.

**Round-4's SameSite test had encoded the defect.** Its first case sent a bare
request with no headers and called it "a same-site request gets the whole jar".
A bare request is exactly what cannot prove same-site. Rewritten so that case
declares `sec-fetch-site: same-origin`, with the metadata-less case added
beneath it — the original trigger still fires, plus the one it missed.

Verification after round 7: **1237 tests / 1234 pass / 0 fail / 3 skipped**
(`.claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/out/FULL-SUITE-ROUND7b.log`), e2e **ALL CHECKS
PASSED / 0 FAIL**, stdio **108**, `buildServer({remote:true})` **45 tools /
`f64bb18…2bb0a6`** unchanged, overlay mirror byte-identical.

Sol round 7 (`briefs/SOL-ROUND7.md`) is running against these fixes and against
both declines.

## 4. Uncommitted set

Modified: `browser/raven-grab.js`, `web/public/raven-grab.js`, `src/grab-bridge.ts`,
`src/index.ts`, `src/reference-tokens.ts`, `test/e2e-pattern-library.mjs`,
`test/reference-tokens.test.mjs`, `test/grab-overlay-key-isolation.test.mjs`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `conversations/2026-08-04-pattern-library.md`, `site/raven.mcpb`,
`web/public/raven.mcpb`.

New: `test/grab-bridge-proxy-round4.test.mjs`, `…-round5.test.mjs`,
`…-round6.test.mjs`, `conversations/2026-08-05-pattern-library-round5.md`, this
file, and evidence under `.claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/`.

## 5. Exact next commands

```sh
git fetch origin && git status --porcelain
git commit --only <explicit paths> --file=<message file>   # never a bare git add + commit
# Sol round-6 falsification pass, detached to a file (a real audit outruns the 10m Bash cap):
codex exec -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
  "$(cat .claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/briefs/SOL-ROUND6.md)" \
  > .claude/patternlib-2026-08-04/out/SOL-ROUND6.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Round-6 brief must cover: the two-guard key boundary and whether each is really
load-bearing; `isProxyGrabSession` and the drain branch; the WebSocket `Origin`
check; and whether the round-6 / key-isolation tests fail when their fixes are
removed.

## 6. Blockers — Andrew only

1. `git push` to `main` (4 commits ahead). **This deploys the live MCP endpoint**
   since the 2026-07-27 unpin — human-gated.
2. `npm publish` (passkey 2FA, his terminal).
3. `cd web && vercel deploy --prod` — the only thing that moves the apex marketing
   site and the public `.mcpb` download.
4. No hold-open bridge is currently running; he has nothing to click yet. A fresh
   `start_grab_session` with `proxy_target` is needed before handoff.
